# üìù Text Summarization Tool using LLM
**Project 16**

**Course:** **420 Artificial Intelligence**  
**Date:** **4/28/25**

---

## üìñ **Project Description**
This project implements a **Text Summarization Tool** that summarizes news articles or research papers using two methods:
- **Extractive Summarization** with the **TextRank** algorithm.
- **Abstractive Summarization** using a pre-trained **LLM** (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`).

The app reads multiple texts from a file, applies both summarization techniques, and outputs the results.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- **Language:** Python
- **Techniques:**
  1. **Extractive Summarization:** Selects key sentences using the `sumy` library (TextRank).
  2. **Abstractive Summarization:** Generates human-like summaries using HuggingFace's `transformers` library with a pre-trained LLM.
- **Process Flow:**
   - Reads articles from `inputs.txt`.
   - Generates both summaries.
   - Saves output to `summaries.txt`.

---

## üöÄ **How to Run**
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the summarization app:
```bash
python summarizer.py
```
3. View the results in summaries.txt.

### **Test 6 (longer text)**
```bash
The global economy has faced numerous challenges over the past decade, including financial crises, pandemics, and geopolitical tensions. These events have disrupted supply chains, increased inflation rates, and shifted the dynamics of international trade. In response, governments and central banks around the world have implemented various monetary and fiscal policies to stabilize markets and support economic recovery.
```
