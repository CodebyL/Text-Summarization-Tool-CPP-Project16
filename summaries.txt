Abstractive: As more business activities are being automated, the need for secure computer systems becomes more apparent. The Internet itself has become critical for governments, companies, financial institutions, and millions of everyday users. Cybersecurity can be obtained only through systematic development; it can not be achieved through haphazard seat-of-the-pants methods. This paper introduces some known threats to cybersecurity, categorizes the threats, and analyzes protection mechanisms and techniques for countering the threats. Approaches to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks are also discussed. ated with the design, development, and deployment of network-based software.
