A cyber physical system (CPS) is a typical product of Industry 4.0, which plays an important role since a CPS is able to integrate the physical and virtual worlds by providing real-time data processing services [1]. More specifically, a CPS allows a physical system to be equipped with a virtual system as a monitor, enabling data collected from the physical world to be analyzed in the virtual world such that decisions can be made to affect the course of physical world. Therefore, a CPS enables integration, sharing and collaboration of information, as well as real-time monitoring and global optimization of systems [2]. There is a wide range of applications in modern industry based on CPSs, such as smart grids, healthcare, aircraft, digital manufacturing and robotics [3]–​[6]. Literature shows that CPS includes, but is not limited to, networked control systems (NCSs), wireless sensor networks, and smart grids.

A CPS consists of a physical system and a cyber system. It results from an integration of physical processing, sensing, computation, communication and control [7]. Its general architecture is shown in Fig. 1. The physical system consists of physical processes, sensors and actuators. The cyber system includes communication networks, computing and control centers. Physical processes are usually considered as a plant that is controlled by a cyber system. As for other components, they have the following functions:

Sensors
They are used for real-time data acquisition.

Actuator
Control commands are executed by corresponding actuators to realize desired physical actions.

Computing and Control Center
It is responsible for receiving data measured by sensors. By analyzing the received data, corresponding control decisions are made by the control center to ensure that physical processes are performed correctly.
